####Stretch:
     -Start with a simple survey to determine if the user is ready to cut the cord, how much tv you watch? do you need to watch shows as soon as they come out? Can you wait to see them? How fast is your internet speed?
     -Utilize an API to see a library of shows on Netflix, HBO, or specific networks
     -Add some opportunity costs to not having the content you want, when you want it. For example, if you arenâ€™t able to stream live sports, do you end up spending $50 at a bar to watch the game instead?
     -Does the decision have to be all or nothing? Would cord-shaving make sense? Put another way, is opting for a more basic cable option, while supplementing with streaming services be more economical?
